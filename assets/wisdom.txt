At night some stars come out, but some are too shy and stay in instead.

We all keep killing time... It's no wonder time kills us all in the end.

We live in the present and the past lives in us as we move together into the future and or something like that...

The happy clam is a yummy clam, but no clam is happy about being eaten.

Love everything, you silly daemons.

Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, but brinner is close too.
